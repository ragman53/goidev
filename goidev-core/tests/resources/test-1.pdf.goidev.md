Several years into the new millennium, Bosnian kitchens excitedly trafÞcked in a sort of a fungal surplus. Submerged in recycled glass jars, slimy worlds of opaque, liquid hyperactivity oversupplied homes with medicinal brews. Unsealed but covered with gauzeÑto allow the plump, slippery, Þzzy collectives of yeast and bacteria to breatheÑthe jars were stashed casually in kitchens, among the common pots of African violets or between pots and pans. They sat fermenting next to other invisible ÞxturesÑan old souvenir, a salt-and-pepper shaker. I barely noticed the jars while investigating health and wealth in Bosnia from 2006 to 2007, precisely because they were almost everywhere and so randomly placed. I also missed them every summer I traveled back until, in 2013, I started voicing a persistent health complaint. In response, tea- and milk-based fermented drinks came highly recommended and with my troubles as a password, the obscure jars emerged from everywhere to animate conversations and interactions, pluripotent and therapeutically promising. The jars of the ready-made drink or the starter cultures passed as gifts through neighborhoods, ofÞces, marketplaces, classiÞeds in the local newspapers and many post-Yugoslav online spaces as therapeutic interventions into health complaints from digestion to high blood pressure, from cancer to stress. Somewhat less reverently, people translated and mixed stories of the medicineÕs proper name, calling it Tibetan mushroom, mushroom from the Caucasus, Japanese mushroom, kombucha, tea or keÞr mushrooms. Some

were explicitly concerned with the microbiological nature of the cultures re-sponsible for the fermentation, but even among the microbe-savvy, the mushroom and, endearingly, the little mushrooms ( gljiva ; gljivice ), remained the favorite terms.

<!-- goidev:page=2 bbox=53.8,293.8,514.1,558.9 role=paragraph -->
The casual naming and frequent confusion between tea- and milk-based homebrewed remedies suggest that in popular practice, it was less certain where the mushroom came from and what kind of a thing, essentially, it was. The claims about what the mushroom could do were taken, trustingly, at the word of those passing along the curative giftÑand then put to trial in oneÕs own kitchen and diet. Those convinced of its beneÞts fed it to the near and dear in a loving, meddling, ongoing experiment of care. This care readily reached further away from oneÕs kitchen, for the guts and comfort of those who could not be readily spoon-fed to wellness: strangers who happened to conÞde their health issues in passing, anywhere, online or in the waiting lines of medical establishments. Those who doubted or had speciÞc questions turned to others for reassurances. In one online post, a woman addressed a keÞr forum with sudden misgivings about the milk-fermenting mushroom, which she cultivated and eagerly distributedÑÒit spreads like madÓÑuntil her husband wondered aloud one day: ÒWho knows what we are drinking! It looks sickly.Ó Her panicked post afÞrms a basic knowledge about practical mattersÑhow to care for the milk keÞr grainsÑand admits a keen desire to continue fermenting, if only someone more knowledgeable would conÞrm the beneÞts and advise on the frequency of use. 1

Recommendations about the medicinal jars and instructions on how to care for the mushrooms tie together fermentation and non-commercial circulation, human and fungal connections. ÒWhen the mushroom doubles [in volume] we split it and give half of it away,Ó reads the tail end of one online post. 2 Similarly, the following online announcement cites the remedial properties of home culti-vation and gifting dispositions: ÒI have enough [tea-based mushroom] to share. I noticed some internet sales. That is simply wrong, because these are mushrooms that are passed on, i.e. gifted.Ó 3

I begin with fermenting jars to think the effervescence and generativity of what sits inside them. The jars in pantries and kitchens host but barely contain a thing that multiplies further and fast, that brews billions of lively biotic forms, urging the giving onward and producing surplus and waste. Whatever lies behind the translucent glass is unclear, though speculations about its origins and nature abound. The remedy is recommended, while the claims about what it does are personally tried and tested: incorporated into diets and, in time, evaluated with the help of biomedical imaging and laboratory tests or Þrsthand observations on

how they make someone look, sleep, digest, or feel. The thing in the jar is known through handling, tasting, and testing. It remains precisely unknown, but it is guessed, imagined, and worked out through varied forms of contact and relation. Wondrous and popular, vague and effective, it urges us to think more creatively about the kinds of things that act and inspire inquiry within the spheres of med-ically plural circulation and social relation.

THE THING IN A JAR

<!-- goidev:page=3 bbox=53.8,338.7,497.6,484.2 role=paragraph -->
This essay is concerned with objects of experiential knowledge and collective speculations. It joins current conversations on the agency of matter, but does so in the spirit of home fermentations, preferring cues from the sites of brewing over the latest terms of ontological inquiries, from object-oriented to neo-vitalist (e.g., Harman 2005 ; Bennett 2009 ). In thinking matter, I foreground the question of the efÞcacy of homemade medicine, emphasizing its varied and unpredictable course, its generativity beyond the medically measurable difference to the signs or experience of illness, while at the same time asking how fermenting cultures, human bodies, and affective associations are substantially formed through popular trials.

<!-- goidev:page=3 bbox=53.8,144.4,508.6,334.7 role=paragraph -->
The jars peddle a lively, quotidian surplus, coproduced through microcul-turesÕ appetites and the popular cultureÕs investment in health and informal ex-change. Fermenting and producing medicine at home, economizing, sharing, and caring are concerned with banal, bodily matters: with the gut ßora and digestive capacities, with gallbladder secretions, good mood, lubricated joints, and clear skin. Banal efÞcacies that make life easier and better are highly desirable but impossible to achieve on oneÕs own, especially given the compromised state of postsocialist public and private health care. Medicinal jars, like other informally obtained therapeutics, occasion and depend on shared bodily experience and col-lective, curative, and intimately transactional practice. SomeoneÕs afßiction or bodily discomfort mobilizes concerned others around practical tasks of recom-mending and procuring the remedy, instructing on its applications and cultivation, and exchanging tips and observations.

<!-- goidev:page=3 bbox=53.8,54.7,503.1,140.4 role=paragraph -->
The mushroom jars, therefore, are phenomenally generative, and not just of Þzzy ßuid and fermenting agents. They foster and ferment bubbly zones of connection and relational innovation, especially since their vagueness begs ques-tions: How best to relate to the mushroom? With whom to relate via the mush-room, and how? They raise such questions in a Bosnian state that has been con-stitutionally and electorally trapped within the politics of ethnonational essence

since the 1995 Dayton Accords ended the genocidal war by sanctifying distinctions between ethnic Serbs, Muslims, and Croats. What is more, the mushroom rem-edies casually traverse the polarized borders of former Yugoslav states as simple items in an informal economy of gifts, medicine, and advice that negotiate logis-tical hassles rather than ideological hurdles.

<!-- goidev:page=4 bbox=53.8,413.4,514.1,529.0 role=paragraph -->
The mushrooms, moreover, are not merely handled: they variously inspire and direct forms of contact, circulation, and speculations on nature and relation. The slippery, pink blob that passes in sugary tea and the grainy clots that curdle milk embody obscure potencies that ßow through recycled jars, generous hands, and mixed stories of origins and substances while altering the encountering mat-ter, from visceral to domestic, from virtual to spatialized. The mushroomsÕ thingly obscurity and patent exuberance, their puzzling appearances and famed perfor-mances, are anything but incidental to this subtle sort of efÞcacity.

Lately, things have exercised the scholarly imagination. Some thinkers are interested in thingsÕ very thingliness, which remains beyond the grasp of human thought and experience, a metaphysical given, if obliquely so ( Heidegger 1971 ), an object of an Òalien phenomenologyÓ ( Bogost 2012 ), or a Òhyper-objectÓ ( Morton 2013 ): an engulÞng presence at a mind-boggling scale. Other scholars attend to how things are and how they act ( Harman 2005 ; Latour 2005 ), how they come into being and pass away ( Daston 2000 ), what force resides in or moves through them ( Ingold 2006 ; Bennett 2010 ), who decides whether they are at all and what power issues from such deliberation on the material design of the world ( Langwick 2011 ; Stengers 2010 ; Povinelli n.d.). SigniÞcant theoretical differences aside, scholars of things have collectively exposed the extent to which non-humans compose the social worlds from which humanist political thought and democratic practice consistently exclude them, or else include them reductively, as dumb utilities or accessories. Moreover, thinkers of things have proposed we consider, sometimes shaming us into doing so, the various political achievements of stuff. From the political ecology of things (Bennett) to the parliament of things (Latour) to cosmopolitics (Stengers), the new materialisms afÞliate with divergent political philosophies that are attuned to what matters potentially and what moves later-allyÑforming knowledge and experienceÑat least as much as to what is actually itemized on the agendas of formal politics. Collectively, the turn to things adds fuel to thinking politics, and indeed to dreaming of change, in a postfoundational mode, collecting the vibes of emergent energies, converging dispositions, and new media and mobilizations across the predictable lines of afÞliation.

Such political propositions frame a compelling volume edited by Bruce Braun and Sarah Whatmore (2010) . Political Matter troubles the reductive idea of Òin-transigent,Ó reactive objects to focus instead on the elastic, eventful, active, and affective qualities of various Òthings that matterÓÑfrom rubbish to plastic to metal. On behalf of the featured authors, Braun and Whatmore call for a more robust engagement with materiality while voicing a shared question: How does stuff ground, pervade, and transform political life, which always already includes more than human collectives? More speciÞcally, the contributors to Political Matter are attentive to the sway of stuff taken for granted that inÞltrates the air as much as political agendas, that inserts itself snuggly in the midst of social gatherings. They Þnd powerful agents at work in the midst of everything that humans arro-gantly consider their own business and attune to the powers that furtively ßirt with each accessorized subject, one earphone at a time. Put simply, the authors assume that being and being social are the primary political concerns of civic life that have never been strictly nor solely human. Recognizing plural and shared Þelds of consequential action makes for a Þrst step in reconstituting public rela-tions and responsibilities.

<!-- goidev:page=5 bbox=53.8,54.8,557.9,349.6 role=paragraph -->
I take to heart the volumeÕs accent on forcefulness and the participation of all sorts of seemingly random and easily missed things, but with the mushroom in sight, I Þnally hesitate to call it political: because, I fear, other kinds of practical signiÞcance would be blanketed by the muscular connotations of a generalized power and because highlighting the politics of matter would hide equally trans-formative and subtly constitutive potencies at work through (medical) knowledge and (health) experience. Moreover, while the contributors to Political Matter are mostly focused on technoscientiÞc and industrial objects or items of capitalist consumer economies, 4 the mushroom constitutes a life-form thriving in and fo-menting terrains of knowledge that only occasionally confer with science. They are mostly otherwise occupied. They busy themselves with the practical and experiential sense more Þtting for the tasks of cooking and home treatment, more in tune with informal and etiologically plural medical advice. The mushroom forms part of the therapeutic lexicon often critical of biomedical and pharmaceu-tical authority, though inconsistently so, skeptical of industrial food technologies, and dashingly inventive and improvisational. This essay thus wonders about the efÞcaciousness of matter on bumpier grounds, where scientiÞc controversy mixes with common sense and wonder, where concepts have never quite achieved the consensual status of factÑwhich Bruno Latour (1988) calls a Òblack boxÓÑbut are instead open and bursting with colorful propositions, speculations, and claims.

Unlike Braun and Whatmore, I am not particularly frustrated with the scholarly Þxation on the thinking-feeling human, but rather interested in how mushrooms shape and are formed by the explorative and experimental imagination. I describe processes whereby the reality of a remedial body is linked with ingesting and inventing, trying and knowing, handling and wondering about what the acting and affecting thing might be. In other words, While Braun and Whatmore are interested in what things do, the mushroom, I suggest, urges us to think more about the nature of what is, especially when the thing remains elusive and open, and its deÞnitions propositional, partly Þctive, enchanted, and playfulÑbut no less inßuential for that.

<!-- goidev:page=6 bbox=53.8,189.2,503.1,454.3 role=paragraph -->
As I will show, it matters that the mushroom is not really or only a mush-room. Nor is it simply a curious vernacular shorthand for tea and milk probiotics. The mushroom is a preferred ontological speculation about a liquid, unstable thing on the brink of exceeding, multiplying, spreading, and sporing; a form slippery to grasp that invokes conßicting properties and inspires wonder; and an aliveliness unlike human or plant, and synonymous with fortuitous, found, and gifted. The mushroom translates imprecisely but earnestly between strange life-forms that alter their allies, hosts, and consumers. It tasks its cultivators and consorts with courting interspecies, interethnic intervention, except that neither species nor ethnicity form a part of the fermentation vocabulary. Speculations are spontaneous, sometimes explicit, and selectively informed by the established ru-brics of life and relation, and they are rarely intimidated by the received or disenchanted criteria for what counts as real, Þctive, and possible. Ontological speculations are popular inquiries that point to the unclosed, underdetermined state of the matter, be it a fungal-yeast collective or human viscera, allowing outlandish interactions between ailing bodies and promising cures. Inquiries prime and take cues from the matter, giving rise to the possibilities that an event may take place outside the realm of a reasonable assumption.

<!-- goidev:page=6 bbox=53.8,54.7,525.0,185.2 role=paragraph -->
The essay proceeds by situating the jars within the tradition of domestic food and medicine in postsocialist circumstances. I spend time describing the terms of practical knowledge that handle and evaluate the mushrooms according to the vital signs of difference that these remedies promise to compromised bod-ies. The circuitous channels of banal power point to plural efÞcacies and causalities of things and suggest that we consider the mushroomsÕ and the mushroom grow-ersÕ receptiveness to varied forms of handling and explanations. Seemingly con-fused therapeutic practices have real effects but a different grasp on medical matters, both the suffering body and the medicinal object. The rest of the essay

ßeshes out, bit by bit, the natures and forces perched in the jars that are super-abundant, irreducible to a single explanatory frame or therapeutic efÞcacy, leading to many points of origin and suggesting multiple and undecidable forms of proper contact and care. I show how the surplus that issues from the jars practically contributes to the popular imagination about the mushroom and to the tender, connective feelings it stirs in and among others. The jars guide collective action in the direction of (non)economic value and medical intervention into subjective and shared bodily experience under the conditions of a perceived health emer-gency and diffused medical expertise.

POSTSOCIALIST HEALTH, HOMEMADE MEDICINE

<!-- goidev:page=7 bbox=53.8,264.0,519.6,439.4 role=paragraph -->
The medicinal thing at hand is related to the agents of fermentation that have attracted attention among global health-conscious, medically curious publics as well as researchers of traditional medicine: kombucha and dairy keÞr. 5 The transnational careers of probiotics and home-fermented drinks offer a number of parallels with gljiva itineraries, but the postsocialist and post-Yugoslav conditions of the jarsÕ handling urge a more hesitant comparison between contexts of practice and an ethnographic investigation of what the jars in Bosnia enclose and do. The regional markets for probiotic drinks and dietary supplements are relatively small, especially in Bosnia, and home fermentation takes place largely outside the pro-biotic frames of reference and within a longer tradition of homemade medicinal meals. The mushroom here thrives under the conditions of a quiet, ongoing public health-care crisis.

<!-- goidev:page=7 bbox=53.8,54.7,519.5,260.0 role=paragraph -->
The World Health Organization (WHO) describes Bosnia as challenged by unequal access to health care. 6 Seventeen to thirty-Þve percent of the population remains without the health insurance that provides access to public health facilities and a few subsidized pharmaceuticals. As elsewhere in postsocialist Eurasia, even the insured rely on payments and personal connections to expedite the provision of care and to secure medical attention by whatever means (see Rivkin-Fish 2005 ). The WHO report on Bosnia underscores regrettable institutional fragmentation, inefÞcient service delivery, and Þnancial unsustainability. At ten percent of the countryÕs GDP, according to the WHO, public and out-of-pocket expenditures for health care lie above the European average in one of the regionÕs poorest states. Bundled together by the WHO under the rubric of Òcomplex political environment,Ó these three issues constitute for the principle impediment to Bos-niaÕs health development. The reportÕs euphemism refers to the constitutional arrangements that split Bosnia into two administrative entities, the Serb Republic

and the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and within the latter, further into two entities, ten cantonal health ministries, and municipal institutions with un-clear divisions of labor, overlapping authorities, varied health beneÞts, and steep operational costs.

<!-- goidev:page=8 bbox=53.8,368.6,519.6,543.9 role=paragraph -->
The administrative and legal framework that emerged from the difÞcult peace negotiations of the 1990s has been amply discussed and criticized (see, e.g., Bougarel, Helms, and Duijzings 2007 ; Kurtovic  2013 ), not least because it locks the state in a tripartite ethnic scheme. And while the ethnonational paradigm is certainly making Bosnian lives more difÞcult, it does not overdetermine them nearly as much as it does policy or scholarly analysis of Bosnia. Scholars interested in health and medicine have been preoccupied with forensic investigations and war trauma, issues that are, unsurprisingly, moored in the ethnonational rubric (e.g., Wagner 2008 ; but see Jansen, Brkovic«, and C ÿ elebc ÿic « forthcoming ). What eludes these studies as well as the WHO becomes apparent when one looks at medicine sideways, attending to places and practices that shift a sense of thera-peutic care and efÞcacy beyond strictly professional or pharmacological action.

<!-- goidev:page=8 bbox=53.8,84.5,503.1,364.6 role=paragraph -->
Since 2006, I have been visiting clinics, pharmacies, health centers, and alternative and traditional medical practices across northeastern and central Bos-nia, interested both in how people are collectively imagining, pursuing, and wait-ing for proper medical attention and in the kinds of health care they receive. I learned that while searching and waiting for treatment, people tirelessly discuss therapeutic options and each otherÕs symptoms and tests, swap complaints, advice, and treatment histories, evaluate health practitioners and medicinal brands. Their therapeutic repertoires commonly include items of more global fame (from noni juice to royal jelly) and the stock of homemade or homegrown ( domac ´e ) sub-stances: those that are collected, cooked, fermented, dried, and mixed at home, in a country house or in someoneÕs yard, often over an open Þre. By 2013, the mushroom jars had lost the currency of the latest fad and entered into the inven-tory of domac«e. While Yugoslav modernist socialism invested in public health and hygiene, in pharmaceuticals and industrial foods, it never quite compromised the venerable standing of domac«e staples, or of folk medicine more generally. Cook-books, womenÕs magazines, and domac«e producers circulated recipes and adver-tised the health beneÞts of fermented and homemade foods, while widely read herbalists made little distinction between meals and medicine (see Sadikovic« 1988 ; Mijatovic« 1982 ; Pelagic« 1972 ).

<!-- goidev:page=8 bbox=53.8,54.7,426.4,80.6 role=paragraph -->
Domac«e is not a kind of gustatory nostalgia that, according to Elizabeth Dunn (2008 , 246Ð48), begrudgingly compels Georgians to can vegetables, both

because of distrust in the postsocialist food industry and to indulge in cravings for pickled vegetables once supplied by the Soviet state. Considering the high rates of foodborne botulism and a public health emergency, Dunn (2008 , 255) regards the pickled jars as sites abandoned by the state and capital and as zones of unpredictability and danger. Like Georgians, post-Yugoslav producers of do-mac«e often doubt the stateÕs food quality control, but they equally mistrust the conÞdence the state and industrial capital have in mass-produced foods with a long shelf life and a brief consumption span. Moreover, the domestic production of food and medicine regained value in Bosnia during the 1990s wartime shortages, when domac«e recipes were excavated, retouched, or ingeniously invented for anything from herbal shampoos to coffee substitutes to meals from weeds. Do-mac«e, however, is not a mere survival tactic but a robust preference for the handmade, preserved, natural ( prirodno ), and perishable.

<!-- goidev:page=9 bbox=53.8,219.1,519.6,409.4 role=paragraph -->
Melissa Caldwell (2004 , 2010 ) Þnds similar pleasures attached to summer garden foods and foraging, especially for mushrooms, in postsocialist Russia. Cald-well (2014) , however, Þnds Russian dietary ethics rooted in an ecological na-tionalism that attunes citizensÕ bodies with the ideas of Russian mother nature and ties rural escapes to state-oriented engagements. Similarly, in postsocialist Bulgaria, the national ßavors certain foods ( Yatova 2013 ). As Japanese dairy mar-ket campaigns designate Bulgaria as the homeland of yogurt and their images repatriate to that country, Maria YatovaÕs interlocutors taste the sourness of dairy as the authentically ethnobacterial quality of local fermenting culture, Lactobacillus bulgaricus. In short, Yatova argues for the bacteriaÕs symbolic capacity to feed and form Bulgarian ethnonational memories and myths. In both postsocialist contexts then, the political careers of homemade foods seem to have particularly ethnon-ational orientations.

In North America, on the other hand, food and value entanglements shift toward concerns with safety and sanitation, as well as to artisanal and do-it-yourself responses to industrial foods. Not surprisingly, microcultures here ex-ercise different associational stunts, which Heather Paxson (2013) captures under the rubric of ÒmicrobiopoliticsÓÑregulated and contested relations between mi-crobes and humans that mark the consumption as well as the production of foods and tastes. Within the pasteurized food culture of the United States, artisan cheesemakers cultivating the microbial complexity of their cheeses while sorting out, meticulously, the good bacteria from the potential ÒbiohazardÓ ( Paxson 2008 , 33). In contrast, home fermentation occupies a more precarious position in North American food politics. Radicalized by food regulations and marginalized by the

mass appeal of antibacterial reason, home fermentation is an ideological stance. Sandor Katz (2003 , 2006 , xiv) includes live-culture foods within a range of un-orthodox, sometimes fringe, food activisms whose countercultural potential he increasingly appreciates as his writing moves from practical guides on wild fer-mentation to a description of broader practices of Òculinary mutiny,Ó from seed saving to scavenging, which he collectively terms AmericaÕs underground food movement. Paxson (2008 , 37) reads Katz as an oracle of the Òpost-PasteurianÓ trend, which owes much to lessons on hygiene and bodily defenses while it fashions forms of self-care around collective, biologized identities.

A comparative gesture here is multiply instructive, showing that regional trends and global regimes are inevitably implicated in local affairs, but never predictably so. Put simply, neither biopolitics nor ethnopolitics neatly contain the mushroom story. Domac«e foods, and the mushroom jars in particular, circulate a medicinal rather than an ethnonational value. Moreover, it is not the microbes but, rather, the mushroom that organizes fermentations, that materializes and banalizes oppositions to the industrial and pharmaceutical commodities, and that engenders broader connections beyond fringe or national solidarities. People carry out comestible trials with the ßair of seasoned cooks or spontaneous inventors, encouraged by countless examples and trusting collective common sense. Brewing within the jars is an acute sense that the history of the war and the postsocialist present have altered local bodies and pluralized afßictions, thus calling for revised and reinvented therapeutic responses. I whittle a critical point from popular in-clinations toward medical experiments and stray away from the language of eth-nonational symbols and of microbes to the more promiscuous descriptions of fermented drinks.

Online venues were often determined to get to the heart of the Þzzy me-dicinal matter. Some authors differentiated between tea and milk fermentations, while emphasizing that there was no mushroom in keÞr, kombucha, Tibetan mushroom, Japanese mushroom, the mushroom from the Caucuses, or Òwhatever else people like to call it.Ó 7 Instead, they pointed to the symbiotic composition of the cultures responsible for herbal and dairy fermentation and further cata-logued their micro-organic and biochemical properties. References recycled a handful of international academic papers in English on Tibetan mushroom and keÞr. Nonetheless, even the online author who pedantically listed dozens of res-ident species and subspecies of yeast and bacteria in keÞr ended the text with a

On the other hand, health circles on the ground seldom worry about the proper name for mushrooms. The cultivatorsÕ attention is nearsighted, Þxated on familiar and immediate links in the broader and convoluted logistical networks that handle popular medicine. The vernacular knowledge that frames homemade medicine, however, is extensive and curious. It registers the certain ease with which the tradition of domac«e embraces the new and the exotic, entertains seem-ingly improbable suggestions, and fans a more general curative and economic signiÞcance of domestic production. One family I visited on the outskirts of Tuzla, a northeastern Bosnian town, traced their fermented medicine to a hairdresser. A jar of black tea with the mushroom, translucent layers ßoating like a trapped jellyÞsh, was among twenty remedies in this familyÕs pharmacy that Mina and her husband, Hariz, fetched to show me one afternoon. The surface of the garden table Þlled with herbs and weeds, freshly plucked or dried in the storeroom; a jar of gluey cream for bone pain (crushed aspirin, gelatin-based soap, and home-brewed brandy); concoctions of herbs, seeds, and honey; fruit and ßower infusions and vinegars. MinaÕs mother-in-law had passed along many recipes. Instructions on how to make the aspirin-gelatin-alcohol cream came from the neighborhood car mechanic to whom MinaÕs husband had complained, in passing, of incapaci-tating and mysterious leg pain. Whereas other herbal remedies had failed, the cream marvelously restored HarizÕs mobility and rid him of pain, inspiring his orthopedic surgeon to analyze a sample and interpret the mechanics of its action. The couple was thrilled to report this formal medical interest in and vindication of folk remedies. MinaÕs hairdresser brought the mushroom after hearing the neighborhood talk of her upcoming breast surgery appointment. Other remedies were simply the common stock of knowledge that, supposedly, Òpeople talk about [pricÿaju ljudi]Ó and Òeveryone knows [svakÕ zna].Ó

The home production of medicine saves money and assures the highest medicinal quality of ingredients: ÒItÕs better than chemistry,Ó Mina says conÞ-dently. One often hears such misgivings about synthetic medicine in Bosnia, al-though pharmaceuticals are commonly self- and overprescribed. Except for an occasional tranquilizer and a daily dose of heart medicine, she disregards her doctorsÕ prescriptions and autonomously manages her blood pressure and choles-terol levels, treats her headaches and chronic stomach aches, keeps her skin youth-ful and cleansed. Moreover, she has revitalized her liver, minimized her surgery scars, regulated her bowl movement, and kept her spirits up through two che-

motherapies, a hysterectomy, a duodenum and heart surgery, as well as a partial mastectomy. Given her health record and the fact that she has had recurrent cancer since 2003, Mina has been a regular visitor at health centers and the regional clinic. She thanks home remedies, however, for prolonging her life be-yond her doctorsÕ expectations.

It is the oral orientation of popular medicine that invites collective inter-ventions and improvisations that adjust recipes according to the userÕs taste and particular bodily responses. In the words of Cvita, who advertises a surplus of keÞr and tea mushrooms in the municipal yellow pages, Òyou have to monitor how [the mushroom] affects your health. Perhaps you need to start with a shorter fermentation . . . the effects are still there but more subtle.Ó Cvita reports that the tea mushroom and milk keÞr regulated her cholesterol levels and curbed her appetite. Mina, conversely, thanks the tea mushroom for regulating her digestion after her hysterectomy. Another woman, Ismeta, praised the tea mushroom for its calming effectsÑÒit sooths the nervesÓÑbut noticed that, sadly, it made her gain weight.

<!-- goidev:page=12 bbox=53.8,174.2,519.6,364.6 role=paragraph -->
The sheer variety of bodily responses that the mushrooms produced did not bother the users, who expected the medicine to affect them singularly and con-sidered the cure to reside not in the predictable pharmacological formula or dosage but in the fortunate coincidence between the irreducibly singular patient and a particular medication. It is perhaps no surprise that a number of home and herbal remedies come recommended with vague statements such as Òit cures everything.Ó Considering that Bosnians otherwise provide minute descriptions of their medical routines and that each remedy is promoted with reference to ex-emplary cases of its efÞcacy, vagueness regarding the mushroom cannot be dis-missed as typically pragmatic inattention to detail. Rather, practitioners of popular medicine know and ÒmonitorÓ experientially, collectively, and with the aid of diagnostic technologies, a kind of bodily being that is particular and unpredictable, continuously bafßing, and promisingly responsive to different forms of care.

Folk optimism about the mushrooms indexes a hands-on familiarity with the body, worked out through trials of natural, traditional, and home medicine. Such medically experimental communities gather elsewhere and particularly around chronic and poorly understood conditions or unorthodox therapies. Chloe Sil-verman (2012) describes joint pursuits of North American parents and physicians allied in their search for alternative understandings of autism. The members of

DAN! (Defeat Autism Now!) conduct and discuss home-based trials of uncon-ventional therapies. Home treatments, Silverman (2012 , 373) suggests, are cau-tious and involve reading anything from childrenÕs faces to feces for subtle clues of physiological and behavioral changes.

<!-- goidev:page=13 bbox=53.8,383.5,497.6,543.9 role=paragraph -->
The same holds true with mushroom gatherings. Nothing is too trivial to mention, guts are spilled when listing problemsÑconstipations, discharges, bad odors, skin rashesÑand no condition seems untreatable. ÒPeople, have no doubt, this mushroom is for real,Ó 8 says one post on Coolinarka , a self-declared online food community. The writer demonstrates Òthe realÓ with blurry ultrasound im-ages of gallbladder stones nearly disappearing thanks to the Tibetan mushroom. The testimonial advises a reader to Òthink twice before [deciding on] surgery.Ó Coolinarka is registered in Croatia but, as many web venues in the Bosnian, Ser-bian, and Croatian languages, it attracts users from throughout the ex-Yugoslav states. Like DAN!, those advertising the mushrooms speak the language of care, except that they advertise its beneÞts to no particular diagnostic afÞliation.

Comparable are also multiple scales of efÞcacy: some consumers are per-fectly content to report Þner transformations, such as feeling energized or re-freshed, while others wish to account for these precisely. One parentÕs endorse-ment of milk keÞr reads: ÒOur child is drinking it and the results are notable in the blood count, c-peptid blood test, and the childÕs entire biochemistry.Ó 9

But here lies a signiÞcant divergence between DAN! and the mushroom cohorts, between SilvermanÕs and my own analytic ambition. To avoid charges of credulity and charlatanism, the North American parents and doctors indignantly translate alternative and home treatments into the language of biomedical pro-cedures. DAN! membersÕ reßexivity perhaps informs SilvermanÕs (2012 , 370) disclaimer: ÒI do not want to suggest a process of indoctrination or induction into ÔirrationalÕ nonscientiÞc belief systems, but rather a secular community that is acutely aware of the social context of systems of reason, and difÞculties inherent in translation and proof.Ó Rather than concede to the normative expectations of rationality (= allopathic = secular = credible) or presume that afÞliation with something non-scientiÞc implies a belief in lieu of access to legitimate evidence and a clinical trial that can never be had, the therapeutic repertoire of the mush-room prompts a second look at the notion of medical efÞcacy. To most mushroom cultivators, biomedicine speaks the ofÞcial language of reason, but they never-theless question its competence and wonder about the limits of its arbitration outside of pharmaceutical and surgical interventions. People rarely chafe at the fact that the value of any medicine, be it herbal, pharmaceutical, or homemade,

is Þgured out not in the scientiÞc trials that guarantee a straightforward relation-ship of cause and effect, plus an expected surplus of adverse effects, but gradually and circumstantially during a personal treatment where multiply causal forces are at work and sometimes at odds with each other. Causality is often a sort of matchmaking, whereby biographical dispositions, the imagination, and quotidian habits, as well as numerous, variously positioned, deceptively small and trivial agentsÑsay three leaves of sage freshly plucked from a garden and chewed on an empty stomach, Þrst thing in the morningÑplay out in an inÞnite number of singular cases of therapeutic recovery or protracted failures. Likewise, efÞcacies are experientially proven even if they remain formally or biometrically unintel-ligible and open to numerous and fantastic interpretations. On the other hand, given the formal sway of modern medicine, it is no surprise that popular health experiments, including with the mushroom, earn some stern commentary. For instance, in response to buoyant claims about the mushroom available on the forum doctor.rs , one Dr. Ivica provides a mock list of the drinkÕs pluripotent therapeutic beneÞts that starts by singing praises and swerves off into unlikely and unrelated uses and effects: ÒIt removes stains, eliminates odors, polishes wood ßoors.Ó 10

Dr. IvicaÕs edgy joke and the DAN! membersÕ self-consciousness bring to mind Isabelle StengersÕs (2003) thoughts about the particularly Òpolemical accentÓ on rationality in medicine, which she traces to the emergence of the experimental method as the authoritative statement on illness and its proper treatments. Med-icine, Stengers (2003 , 14Ð16) suggests, is stalked by the Þgure of the Òcharlatan,Ó with a long lineage including Dr. Mesmer, whose magnetic-ßuids therapy was famously included in medical trials in 1784 that were to model a distinction between medicine proper and putatively improper cures, which worked, but for Òthe wrong reason.Ó In short, the efÞcacy of magnetic ßuids could not be isolated and was dismissed as a Òpower of the imagination,Ó a power worked up between a compelling charlatan and his allies: the impressionable bodies ( Stengers 2003 , 15, 23). The same power has been since controlled for in clinical trials that aim to turn bodies into Òreliable witnessesÓ for a rational medicineÕs predictions under the conditions of an experiment. Stengers (2003 , 25, 29) argues that Òthere is nothing mysterious or spiritualist in supposing that a living body may not satisfy experimental requirements,Ó since beings irreducibly embody imaginative, mean-ingful potential and so cannot ever Òauthenticate the Ôreal doctorÕ as against the Ôcharlatan.ÕÓ She predicts Òa radical disjunctureÓ between evidence-based medi-

Instead, my ethnography Þnds some fungal spheres where the polemic is unsettled or informally resolved through partial translations, where lay publics are invested in turning their bodies into evidence via biomedical measures or imaginative technologies. A bodyÕs bold responsiveness to unpredictable, subjec-tively experienced, collectively praised, curative things is made exemplary through narratives and their circulation with whatever remedies are put on trial. SigniÞcantly, promising cures are never strictly medical objects, but things ther-apeutically cultivated, preserved, and charged in the course of (non)economic circulation and redistribution.

FUNGAL PRESENT

<!-- goidev:page=15 bbox=53.8,174.3,508.6,409.5 role=paragraph -->
The mushroomsÕ efÞcacies have much to do with the therapeutic economies that the jars presume and invigorate. This is another clue about fungal nature that I picked up in the Þeld, not least by following an advertisement in the municipal yellow pages for a surplus of Òtea and dairy mushroomsÓ and, with the help of my older sister, found Cvita. Cvita gifted her tea culture but told us, apologeti-cally, that she usually takes whatever money people are willing to give in exchange for the keÞr grains. My sister gave 10 konvertible marks (around $7) and, after we left, protested: the advertisement read Òmushrooms to giveÓ; Òthose thingsÓ should not be sold. Cvita, a retired kindergarten cook, received both the tea and the dairy mushrooms as gifts from her sister, a migrant care worker in Germany who in turn got them for free from her employer, an elderly lady. Cvita produces tea and dairy keÞr for her daughter and has passed the gift of mushrooms on to all her daughtersÕ colleagues, physical therapists working in a public clinic. Put simply, the mushrooms circulated to and from Cvita through multiple spheres of exchange: sometimes a gift and other times a tentative commodity, given without a price, for the present of Òhowever muchÓ money.

Even the multiple and conßicting histories of the mushrooms written on the Internet converge at the mythical point of departure, which is a present. Tibetan mushroom is said to have arrived in Europe from Russia as a gift; to have traveled from India or Tibet, with a German (sometimes Polish) professor whom Tibetan monks cured of grave liver illness (sometimes liver cancer) and dispatched with a bacterial gift. The keÞr grains are sometimes traced to a Caucasian legend of the ProphetÕs gift. More than one article shifts geopolitical coordinates of gen-erosity to draw in the unlikely Þgure of Ronald Reagan, retired and undergoing

The gift is incorporated into the very nature of probiotic cultures. Whatever else it is, the mushroom is giving. Before launching into Òmore precise, micro-biological descriptions,Ó one article introduces kombucha as Òthe mushroom that is selßessly shared.Ó 12 Both tea and dairy mushrooms are described as life-forms that reproduce themselves while producing a boundless surplus ( vis ak ) whose management becomes an explicit concern for online and other collectives. Grounded in the region-wide economies of debt, limited liquidity, informalized and irregular employment, minimum pensions and depressed wages, those at-tending to health and life cultivate vital surpluses and handle it lavishly, not as a nostalgic form of socialist public property but as a postsocialist revolving gift that was never owned so much as received to be redistributed. The mushrooms arrive to engender excess not entirely due to the labor of their hosts but owing to their own fecundity, their ferocious penchant for being (more). Mushroom growers steer this surplus away from monetary exchange. Sites devoted to milk keÞr issue solicitations, such as: ÒIs there anyone who has a surplus to gift? I am from Belgrade.Ó ÒIf someone has surplus, please let them share. I am from Sarajevo.Ó 13 While each post locates the offering or a request onto a map that simultaneously ßags geographical proximities and political distances between, say, Belgrade and Sarajevo, the capitals of Serbia and Bosnia, they seem to be read in mostly logistical modes. Responses are followed by further arrangements, to pick up, drop off, or send via an intermediary batches of live cultures, or to mail dried keÞr grains to addresses throughout post-Yugoslav states.

Advertised with the gift is a tacit predicament of hosting a mushroom whose procreative ambition exceeds oneÕs relational resources. Whatever else it is, the mushroom is a kind of a thing that is too much, that grows madly. One post issues from the threshold of an imminent fungal oversupply: ÒThey reproduce so fast that soon youÕll have enough to feed the entire town!Ó while another publishes the moment after the gifting capacities have been exhausted: ÒI have run out of people to gift but I would feel sad to throw [the mushroom] away.Ó 14

economical and ÒsuperÓ medicinal domestic remedy from disappearing; Òit would be a shame.Ó 15 Others are unnerved by the mushroomsÕ evident aliveness. One woman spoke to me of throwing keÞr grains into a stream, and the memory sounded a sense of failure years later. Her turning to the stream, instead of a trashcan, resonates with a wider resistance to dumping the mushroom, nesting ethical concerns in affective registers: ÒI have a surplus but have no heart to throw it away.Ó Or, ÒI can send it if anyone wants it; I would be sad to have to murder them, i.e., trash them.Ó 16 Online venues thus become a mode of achieving what anthropologists of the gift, following Nancy Munn (1986) , understand as a spa-tiotemporal extension of oneÕs otherwise limited, embodied reach, except that here the expansion of oneÕs inßuence responds to the vital demands of the bac-terial-yeast, Þctively fungal collective. Gifting announcements effectively seek human recipients to present to the mushrooms. In both chat rooms and by word of mouth, a Kula ring of sorts is established to peddle the mushroom jars, spread-ing their fame and rolling out the spirit of this medicinal gift.

<!-- goidev:page=17 bbox=53.8,114.5,508.6,379.5 role=paragraph -->
A spirit indeed: of mimetic generosity inspired by the superabundant form, trying and potentially exhausting [the] humans; of domestic ventures in nourish-ing, bottling, delivering, and mailing biotic associations to others. Whatever else it is, the mushroom is spirited, invigorating curative ßows. KeÞr fans are not entirely abandoning industrial food or commodity mediations, but in the service of the stunningly alive and generative fungi-bacterial populations, they valorize non-capitalist common sense. They do so regularly from within the virtual do-mains of corporate capital. Coolinarka, so vigorously involved with the mush-room, is an online subsidiary of Podravka, a Croatian food giant with transnational ambitions that grew out of Yugoslav pedagogies of socialist consumption. The mushroom here feels at home, although the logic of domac«e is at odds with PodravkaÕs line of instant soups or its famous brand of seasoningÑVegetaÑwhich is irreplaceable in dishes throughout the ex-Yugoslav region, packed with mono-sodium glutamate (MSG) and a touch of historical ßavoring, sedimented, a spoon-ful at a time, in the course of televised episodes of Little Secrets of Great Kitchen Chefs on socialist TV. Commodity, too, seems to mushroom: it overgrows, dis-creetly and indiscriminately, the quotidian terrains on which other ways of being and exchanging thrive.

<!-- goidev:page=17 bbox=53.8,54.7,492.2,110.5 role=paragraph -->
However, it is not merely a socialist memory or lapses of transitional econ-omy that allow the mushroom to grow non-commercial expectations: an online search for kombucha, Tibetan mushroom, or keÞr grains in English, Italian, or Spanish will also yield gift offerings. 17 The gifting announcements speak to a

ACCIDENTAL AND WONDROUS

<!-- goidev:page=18 bbox=53.8,263.9,525.0,514.1 role=paragraph -->
The mushroom thrives under the conditions of amateur handling. Whatever else it is, the mushroom is a contingent medicinal thing. It arrives with micro-biological and social traces of its previous hosts. It dwells, resonant with the ever-changing microclimates of its surroundings. People report its reactions to humid-ity or noise. It changes in discernable waysÑthe drink becomes more sour, Þzzier, thinner, or gooier, sometimes infested with worms. The tea mushroom can turn sluggish, tend toward the bottom, grow long whiskers, or change its pink body pleats for boggy browns. The keÞr grains relax, turning ßaccid and soupy. And experienced palates detect many more imperceptible but somehow consequential alterations or imagine them to be at work when the drink is served, imbibed, or when cultures pass onward. Instead of the infectious disease that Elizabeth Dunn, ever an ethnographer as well as a consultant for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC), traces to home canning in Georgia, an undecided contagion is at work in the Bosnian kitchens, a metaphysical sway swirling with the gift, vaguely and indeterminately, energizing the already promising capacity of the gummy clusters and their restless fungal, bacterial, and cellular resident worlds, foreseeing biochemical blasts in the encountering bodies.

<!-- goidev:page=18 bbox=53.8,114.5,508.6,260.0 role=paragraph -->
The accidental is precisely the medicinal. For cultivators like Cvita or Mina, home medicine means taking special care with the ingredients and patiently wait-ing through the fermentationÑsometimes up to Þve days or a few weeksÑwhile relying on the unknown potencies of the mushroom to enliven the rest. Some advocate wild fermentation in the idiom of probiotics, claiming that pasteurization disrupts the spontaneous and secondary fermentation and that store-bought prod-ucts circulate a reduced and controlled bacterial stock. Many online authors em-phasize that the symbiotic bacterial-yeast composition of the home-cultivated mushroom is a mystery, found nowhere in nature and impossible to reproduce in a laboratory.

<!-- goidev:page=18 bbox=53.8,54.7,503.1,110.5 role=paragraph -->
The value of the accident is more generally appreciated among fans of fer-mentation, be they in ex-Yugoslavia or in North America, and most vividly praised in the writings of Sandor Katz.  Katz (2003) , who has been on antiretroviral drugs for years, is especially ßuent in the microbiotic and biomedical lexicons, but he

<!-- goidev:page=19 bbox=53.8,398.5,508.6,603.7 role=paragraph -->
also pitches the relationship with microbes in terms of transformative magics and mundane wonders. He professes a fermentation fetishism. Citing Webster Õs deÞ-nition of fetish as anything Òsupposed to posses magical powersÓ and drawing on his cooking practice, he celebrates low-tech, primitive kitchen techniques as an-cient rituals and credits non-experts with awesome powers. Fermentation is an irresistible, gentle force, the fetishist writes, that slowly makes a difference in the ingredients, in consuming bodies, and in the wider ecology of relationships. He presumes that his readers are apprentices and encourages them to connect to the magic of the natural world, to trust Òyour instinctsÑyou donÕt need chemical analysis to tell whether food is healthyÓ ( Katz 2003 , 7). Such language, no doubt, can make a cautious anthropologist wary of romantic ideas about magic and in-stinctive knowledge. With public health concerns in mind, Paxson (2013 , 2) also worries that the post-Pasteurians tend to Òexaggerate the natural goodness of microbes grown in the wild.Ó

The North American soft drinks industry, which has capitalized on the pro-biotic trend, is gingerly dancing between Katz-style fetishism and antiseptic public health policy. Kombucha Wonder Drink and some of its competitors develop poetic narratives analogous to the mushroomsÕ Internet histories, tracing their beginnings to accidental discoveries of secret knowledge in ethnic places, far away, gifted to the companiesÕ founders, who brewed it at Þrst in their own kitchens. 18 Nonetheless, Kombucha Wonder Drink clearly advocates pasteurization, choosing sides in the microbiopolitical controversy over controlled versus wild fermenta-tion. 19 Designated by Beverage World Magazine as the Òbreakout brandÓ of 2013, Kombucha Wonder Drink wants to dispel the Òbiggest misconceptionÓ that kom-bucha is either curative or mushroom-related. Invoking an unnamed authority (Òa biologistÓ who Òstudied extensivelyÓ), the trendy business ventriloquizes science and responds symmetrically to lay skepticisms of science and industry: there is no scientiÞc basis (Òno evidence,Ó Òno original researchÓ) for kombuchaÕs reputed health beneÞts. Promoting something he calls Òreal-speak,Ó the companyÕs co-founder nevertheless wants to keep wonder as part of the brandÕs identity, which is ÒaspirationalÑwho doesnÕt want to ponder the promise of a Ôwonder drink?ÕÓÑ for as long as all are clear that wonder is not Òa magic cure-all.Ó 20

manner. It gains critical distance and commercial value from wonder by settling on a scientiÞc measure (Òno evidenceÓ) for what there might be in the fermented tea: nothing vaguely medicinal but acids that feed into Òour normal energy pro-ducing metabolismÓ and, possibly, increase energy and improve digestion.

In Bosnian kitchens, conversely, wild fermentations are brewing ontological speculations on fermenting agents and on cultivating and consuming bodies. Since home trials have inspired me with conÞdence that dietary experiments are often effective or adjusted, but in any case attuned to multiple causalities and therapeutic possibilities, and that experience is a trustworthy therapeutic guide, my approach to popular enthusiasm for fermenting mushrooms is less cautious than curious, indeed excited, about the nature of the thing that compels wonderÑfrom Bosnia to North America.

Throughout Bosnia, fermentation and the circulation of remedies in a jar thrive in the shadow of a mushroom, gljiva. Typically a conditional sort, growing wildly at random places, given the season and the right weather, gljiva is a syn-onym for vigorous, unpredictable growth, as in the saying that something or someone Ògrows like a mushroom [raste ko gljiva].Ó The edible kinds hide in forests or Þelds, too easily confused with their poisonous doubles unless one knows better or relies on other experts to tell the difference. They are ideally foraged or received from friends, neighbors, and family. Otherwise they are bought from foragers in precious bundles. On the other hand, stories of fatal fungal poisoning resurface each season, and the medical staff of the clinic for infectious diseases reproaches their patients for daring to eat wild mushrooms, even as they roll in from the ambulance, vomiting and shivering, losing their grip on consciousness. A fear of poisoning keeps some avid collectors from consuming and cautions some cooks to stick to the plainest, farm-harvested, store-bought champignons. Interestingly, fungal toxicity is not a part of the regional imaginaries of the mushrooms that are selectively repurposed and redirected to take new form as a medicinal pseudo-mushroom in a jar. Whereas gifting in Bosnia is typically a precarious affair, demanding a tactful steering away from insulting and hurting, smuggling in irrevocable, reciprocal debts (see Jasarevic 2012 ), poison is not readily suspected in the mushroom gift.

Anna Tsing (2012 , 141) prompts us to Òconsider mushrooms.Ó She Þnds fungi thriving in symbiotic associations, huddled Òdefensively in neglected mar-gins,Ó and spreading through accidents and interrelationships, not always benign. With other species mushrooms grow largely outside the schemes of domestica-tion, they are the unearned gifts of a local, ecological bounty or unintended escorts to human ventures, from colonial seafaring to radioactive contamination ( Tsing 2012 , 149, 151). While the history of grain production mythologizes human independence from other species and clearly inscribes private property and speciÞc purposes to the land, the mushroomsÕ growing and foraging takes place in diverse landscapes, companionate relations, and overlapping sovereignties. In short, mushrooms, according to Tsing (2012 , 141, 151), model the universal nature of interspecies relation and sustain a different economy, be it of foraging or global commercial mushroom picking. They afford a critical insight into associative pos-sibilities and biological diversity at the unruly edges and in the seams of what, I think, Tsing here means by Òan empireÓ: manifold, historically wielded forms of domestication and discipline of the biological species, framed by persuasive prop-erty relations that conÞne love and care to family while prescribing economic rationality toward strangers.

<!-- goidev:page=21 bbox=53.8,249.0,486.7,334.7 role=paragraph -->
The medicinal mushrooms in jars, on the other hand, are affecting economic and relational practices from within domestic spaces. Fostered rather than do-mesticated, the mushrooms are grown with hopes that they will overgrow their humansÕ bodies and are fed and sent onward, with much optimism, to associates and strangers. And this gesture onwardÑa gifting forth of a surplusÑis itself endorsed by the mushroomsÕ giving nature.

Importantly, the mushroom in this corner of the Balkans is not only a (micro-) organic, fungi-bacterial form but also a collective, sustained Þction, signed with jestÑ :D. The Þctive form of the mushroom provides cultivators with a handle on the biotic companions but does not decisively steer a relational imagination toward the thing itself. Nor is this a sensible kind of wonder packed in a handy commodity form that demands no contemplation beyond consumption: choosing the right ßavor for the right price or favoring a brand. Rather, how to properly attend to the mushrooms was an ongoing problem, constantly pondered and collectively tackled. There is plenty of advice on reading mushroomsÕ moods and states: is it healthy when it ÒßoatsÓ or ÒsinksÓ; is it ÒsickÓ when the grains are overly slimy, and how then to cure it? The cultivators shift between registers of familiar relationsÑhuman to human, human to plant or animal, being to being in generalÑconsidering and recommending suitable forms: ÒIt is aliveÓ; Òtreat it

<!-- goidev:page=22 bbox=53.8,368.6,519.5,514.1 role=paragraph -->
The handling problem recurs, rehearsing the unresolved questions: What is the object of contact and a form of connection? How do you touch the mushroom to preserve its vitality and potency or, indeed, to please it: immediately, Þngers to its body, or through intermediaries, and then of what kind? Warnings about touching include suggestions to Ògently massageÓ the keÞr grains, Òwhich, accord-ing to some, like to be patted.Ó 22 Related is the question of culturesÕ cleansing. One Alan asserts that Òwashing is torture for the [keÞr] grains. They have to contaminate milk with their bacteria and yeast.Ó 23 Contagion is courted and the production is thoroughly caught up in the care of the undecided aliveness in the jar.

<!-- goidev:page=22 bbox=53.8,129.4,519.6,364.6 role=paragraph -->
Whatever it may be in the jar, it is earnestly made up as the mushroom. A microbiologist would tell us that the yeast in the symbiotic composition of the mushrooms is, in fact, a fungal organism and that mushrooms are associated microbes made visible to the eye. But I am not interested in establishing a formal symmetry between the vernacular and the microbiological take on the things in the jar. My point is neither that popular stories about nature are meaningful if there exist poetic ßourishes to the real, microbiotic composition of the thing, nor that, essentially, nothing substantial exists but, a` la Bruno Latour, that we Þnd only exteriority of horizontal, natural-cultural actants assembling and reassem-bling, all on the surface, into black boxes or propositions. Rather, the Þction of the fungus, the yeast, and the bacteria, the delicate inßuences of the surroundings, and the many clues about the stuff in the jarÑgiving, excessive, accidental, spir-ited, wondrousÑeffectively, logistically, and inconclusively make up this thera-peutic thing, which, whatever else it is, is fermenting. Fermentation brings up from obscurity a Þzzy potential, a curative promise, a relational riddle, putting the cultivators to work, to share, to ponder.

<!-- goidev:page=22 bbox=53.8,54.7,525.0,125.5 role=paragraph -->
Things fermenting are especially effectual. While the jars themselves enjoy eventful careers of recycling, the stuff inside them is more intensely alive. It is both original, issuing forth, and historical, having arrived from places, with traces, known and mythical. It manifests being as obviously plural: composed of grains, folds, and microbes, responding to many names and ailments. It models prom-

issory potencies, mostly undisclosed, of an agent capable of interacting in inÞnitely varied ways, depending on the singular consuming-cultivating bodies and land-scapes of circulation. It stimulates practically philosophical speculations, not al-ways explicit but proposed and tested in the course of fungal-human coconsump-tion. The inquiries are conceivable only because the bodily capacity of the mushroom-minding humans is as unresolved as the matter of the mushrooms, and so their natures are substantially worked and worked out through trials. I want to insist on the widely consequential power of amateur trials and on forms of guessing and knowing that are elaborate or enchanted rather than experimentally sensible. In other words, my challenge is to think with things that are logistically hyperactive, socially voracious, therapeutically potent, and not just vague but other than what they are said to beÑmushroomsÑwhile analyzing, all along, how they matter and what matters to them, from guts to utensils, from borders to the relational imaginations of their hosts. Home trials and practical inquiries, as well as the playful pretense about the mushroom, play out in the domain that Stengers (2003 , 23) calls ÒimaginationÓ and that she wants to reclaim from the stock of forces and attributes suspected by rational medicine in its struggle against charlatans and treacherously susceptible bodies. Imagination, Stengers suggests, is a vital responsiveness of all living organisms that can be neither predicted nor controlled for. Since mushrooms and humans respond to each other differently but insistently, cuing the interventions and improvisations, shaping experiences and effects, imagination stirs the very ßesh of the things in the jar, which remains essentially unsettled, and keeps bubbling.

IN CONCLUSION: Banal EfÞcacies

<!-- goidev:page=23 bbox=53.8,54.8,519.6,230.1 role=paragraph -->
The mushrooms in the jars prompt us to think more playfully with and about the kinds of things that exist, affect, and inspire wonder, that are cultivated and made up broadly across social spaces and, particularly, in post-Yugoslav ter-rains. Home fermentation rings, online and on the ground, span the region, transformative and transactional. They nurture and distribute mushroom jars with a reverence for the regional tradition of domac«e foods and medicine. If the lively jars are abandoned by the state and capital, they are also found, and doubly so: discovered by chance, through advertisements and other peopleÕs offerings. They are established and tended with devotion as a preferred course of medical and economic action. The mushroom tenderly translates alien forms to the more familiar strangeness of the uncontained vitality, which Þgures and cues anew the perennial problem of being social. The Þctive fungus precisely trespasses the

<!-- goidev:page=24 bbox=53.8,308.8,508.6,603.7 role=paragraph -->
affective limits of the home economy or of some default (species, ethnic, or national) collective. They mobilize their cultivators around issues of health care, but in so doing, they nurture extensions across post-Yugoslav regions in manners not anticipated by more formal visions of postconßict cooperation. Sometimes glossed as the ÒYugosphere,Ó 24 the understated economic relationships between the former Yugoslav states are either condemned as nostalgic and politically re-active or credited with a political promise of facilitating integration and the re-gionÕs accession to the European Union. The ontologically speculative biotic col-lectives are busy outside this model of economic pragmatism, but they are economizing, gifting, and distributing surpluses, wielding considerable power without an overly ambitious project. They are not isolated examples of useful, ground-level exchanges between the former states, but are remarkably intimate, given the consensus on the gift and the swaps of delicate traces of bodily and kitchen ecologies. Favoring banal effects over ethnonational matters, pursuing obscure natures rather than multiethnic essences, they intervene in matters of being and experience, affecting life-forms and gathering subjects, practically minded and invested in bodies and therapeutic objects. What gathers them, how-ever, are new and thrilling forms of being together that claim attention, urge generous action, and ferment the imagination around the abundance of unlikely things.

Acknowledgments I offer my sincere thanks to many people who exercised their patience, imagination, and editing talents on this piece. Thanks especially to Caryn OÕConnell, Aleksandr Prigozhin, Owen Kohl, Andy Graan, Larisa Kurtovic, Jim Hevia, Michele Rivkin-Fisch, and Erin Koch. Judy Farquhar, as ever, inspired. A grateful nod to my fermentation teachers across Bosnia, as well as to the participants of the 2014 SOYUZ (Research Network for Postsocialist Cultural Studies) conference who tasted the keÞr: jointly they showed the way to truly thinking with things. In Bosnia, Slavica Ibrisimovic, Mirza Muftic, Azra Jasarevic, and my parents got exceedingly involved with the mushroom and sustained this project; without Nerka, however, the mushrooming affairs would have turned tragic. Finally, my deepest thanks to Cultural Anthropology Õs anonymous readers, the editorial team, and most of all, to the generous and insightful Cymene HoweÑwithout all of you, this would have been simply a nice try. 1 .
